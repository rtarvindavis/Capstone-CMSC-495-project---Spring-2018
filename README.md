# SkillBlazerDev
# Prototype uploaded on March 22nd (depending on where you live)

# Removed files from the top-level directory so that the package statement works nicely in NetBeans, Eclipse and IntelliJ

# Added JSON-simple-1.1.1.jar to the top level of the repo so its easy to find if you need to add it into your project or IDE library.  This 
# will not compensate for not having the library set up!
